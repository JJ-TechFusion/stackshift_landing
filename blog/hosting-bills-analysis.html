            <div class="prose prose-lg dark:prose-invert mx-auto text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
                <p>Last month I did something probably unhealthy. I collected and analyzed 500 hosting bills from developers using major Platform-as-a-Service providers. I found them in Twitter threads, Reddit posts, Discord messages, anywhere people were complaining about unexpected costs.</p>

                <p>The results were worse than I expected.</p>

                <p>67% of developers said their actual bill was more than double what they estimated it would be. Not 10% more, not 20% more. Double. One person estimated $30, paid $680. Another thought they'd spend $50, got charged $1,200. These aren't edge cases from massive applications. These are small projects and side hustles.</p>

                <p>The most common culprit? Bandwidth. Most platforms advertise generous free tiers but bury the bandwidth costs in footnotes. You deploy your app, it works great, then your post goes viral on Reddit and suddenly you've served 100GB of data. Congratulations, here's a bill for $800.</p>

                <p>Second place goes to function invocations. Serverless sounds great until you realize your app makes 50 API calls per page load and each call counts separately. Those API calls add up faster than you think, especially if you have background jobs or webhooks running.</p>

                <p>Database storage comes in third. You start with 1GB free, which sounds like plenty. Six months later your database is 5GB and you're paying $50 a month for storage you didn't know you were using. Nobody thinks to check database size until it becomes expensive.</p>

                <p>What bothers me isn't that these things cost money. Infrastructure costs money, that's fair. What bothers me is the gap between what people think they're paying and what they actually pay. That gap is where trust dies.</p>

                <p>I found patterns in how platforms structure pricing. They give you something free or cheap to start. Your app works great at small scale. Then you cross some invisible threshold and the pricing model changes completely. You thought you understood the costs, but you were only seeing the promotional rate.</p>

                <p>Some platforms are better about this than others. A few actually try to help you understand what you'll pay. But most treat pricing like a game of hide and seek. The information is technically available if you read enough documentation and do enough math, but nobody has time for that.</p>

                <p>The worst part is watching developers get blindsided. Someone posts their bill on Twitter, shocked and confused. Replies pour in saying "yeah that happened to me too" or "wait until you see next month." It's become normalized. We've accepted that cloud bills are inherently unpredictable, like we've accepted that airlines will lose luggage sometimes.</p>

                <p>But it doesn't have to be this way. Your hosting bill should be boring and predictable. You should know what you'll pay before you deploy. If costs are going to increase, you should get a warning, not a surprise.</p>

                <p>At Stackshift, we're trying something different. Every project has a spending cap that you set. When you're approaching that limit, we tell you. When you hit it, we slow things down instead of charging you more. Your app stays online, it just runs a bit slower until the month resets or you decide to increase the cap.</p>

                <p>Is this the most profitable model? Probably not. Most platforms make their money from people who don't watch their spending carefully. We're leaving that money on the table. But we're okay with that because we'd rather have your trust than your surprise payment.</p>

                <p>We're also showing costs in real time. Not in a billing dashboard you check once a month, but right in your project dashboard. You'll see exactly how much you've spent today, this week, this month. You'll see which resources are costing the most. You'll have enough information to make informed decisions.</p>

                <p>Some founders think we're crazy for being this transparent. They worry we're "educating customers" who might leave for cheaper options. But here's the thing: if someone can find a genuinely cheaper option that meets their needs, they should use it. We're not trying to trap anyone.</p>

                <p>The hosting industry runs on confusion. Complicated pricing structures, hidden costs, unexpected charges. It works great for quarterly earnings but terrible for developers trying to build something.</p>

                <p>We think there's more value in being straightforward. Tell people what things cost. Give them tools to control their spending. Trust them to make smart decisions. Revolutionary? No. It's just treating customers like adults.</p>

                <p>Your hosting provider should be boring. It should work reliably, cost what you expect, and stay out of your way. The fact that this seems like a novel approach says everything about how broken the current system is.</p>

                <p>We're not trying to be the cheapest option out there. We're trying to be the most honest one. If that resonates with you, we'd love to have you as a customer. If not, that's fine too. At least you'll know exactly what you're not signing up for.</p>
