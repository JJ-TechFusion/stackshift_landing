                <p>My friend Sarah runs an online marketplace in Lagos connecting freelancers with local businesses. She built it herself over six months, got some early users through word of mouth, and things were growing steadily. Everything seemed fine until she noticed something weird in her analytics. Users would start filling out their profile, then abandon it halfway through. Her completion rate was terrible compared to similar platforms.</p>

                <p>She spent weeks trying to fix it. Simplified the forms, reduced the number of fields, added progress indicators. Nothing worked. Then someone suggested she check where her server was actually hosted.</p>

                <p>Frankfurt. Every time someone uploaded a profile photo or saved their information, the request traveled to Germany and back. For users in Lagos, each interaction took about 500 milliseconds. Half a second doesn't sound like much until you realize it's happening on every single action. Click to add a skill, wait. Upload a photo, wait. Save your bio, wait.</p>

                <p>Users don't consciously notice 500ms. They just feel like your app is slow and leave. The data backs this up. Amazon found that every 100ms of latency costs them 1% in sales. Google discovered that an extra half second in search results could decrease traffic by 20%. These companies obsess over milliseconds because milliseconds matter.</p>

                <p>But if you're building in Africa, your options are limited. The major cloud providers have data centers in Europe and the US. Some have expanded to Asia. Africa? Not so much. There's one region in South Africa, which helps if your users are in Johannesburg but does nothing if they're in Nigeria, Kenya, or Ghana.</p>

                <p>So you deploy to Europe and accept the latency tax. Your users in London get 20ms response times while your users in Lagos get 500ms. Same product, wildly different experience. And you pay the same price for both.</p>

                <p>This isn't just a technical problem. It's an economic one. Startups in Africa are competing with global companies that have better infrastructure access. A user comparing your product to an international competitor isn't thinking about where the servers are. They just know one feels fast and one feels slow.</p>

                <p>The standard advice is to use a CDN for static assets, which helps with images and scripts. But your API calls still make that round trip. Your database queries still cross an ocean. Your real-time features still lag. CDNs solve maybe 30% of the problem.</p>

                <p>Some companies solve this by raising enough money to negotiate custom deals with cloud providers. They get priority access to new regions, special pricing, dedicated support. If you can't raise millions, you're stuck with whatever consumer-grade solution exists.</p>

                <p>We started building Stackshift because we got tired of explaining to founders why their infrastructure choices were limited by geography. The technology to fix this exists. The fiber optic cables are already laid. The data centers are already built in African cities. What's missing is platforms that actually use them.</p>

                <p>When we launch, you'll be able to deploy to Cape Town or Lagos as easily as you deploy to Frankfurt. Same price, same interface, same features. Your users in Africa will get the same experience as users anywhere else. Not because we're doing anything revolutionary, but because we're doing the obvious thing that nobody else bothered to do.</p>

                <p>Latency matters. Your users might not know why your app feels slow, but they'll definitely know it feels slow. And slow apps don't win, regardless of how good everything else is.</p>

                <p>The internet was supposed to make geography irrelevant. For people building in Africa, it just moved the disadvantage from access to performance. We can fix that. It just requires actually caring about it.</p>
