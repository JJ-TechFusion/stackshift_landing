                <p>I spent three hours yesterday explaining to a friend why his hosting bill was $347 when he expected $25. His Next.js app got some traction on Reddit, traffic spiked for a few hours, and suddenly he owed more than his rent.</p>

                <p>This isn't rare. This is normal now.</p>

                <p>The cloud hosting world has split into two camps. On one side, you have the platforms that make deployment dead simple. Push to GitHub, watch the magic happen, your app is live in minutes. It feels amazing until the bill arrives. Bandwidth costs that scale exponentially. Function invocations you didn't even know were happening. Suddenly you're paying enterprise prices for your side project.</p>

                <p>On the other side, you have the hyperscalers. They're cheap if you know what you're doing, but "knowing what you're doing" means understanding VPCs, security groups, load balancers, auto-scaling policies, and about fifty other concepts that have nothing to do with your actual product. You wanted to build a todo app, not become a solutions architect.</p>

                <p>I've been on both sides of this. I've paid the premium for simplicity and regretted it when my card got declined because of a surprise bill. I've also spent entire weekends configuring infrastructure when I should have been shipping features. Both paths suck in their own special way.</p>

                <p>Here's what frustrates me most: it doesn't have to be this complicated. The technology exists to make deployment simple AND affordable. The business models just haven't caught up.</p>

                <p>Most platforms optimize for their revenue, not your success. They want you to start cheap and scale expensive. The free tier hooks you, you build your product on their platform, you get users, and then the pricing model reveals itself. By then you're too invested to leave easily. Some call this smart business. I call it predatory.</p>

                <p>We're building Stackshift because we believe there's a third option. You shouldn't have to choose between developer experience and fair pricing. You shouldn't need a devops team to deploy a web app. And you definitely shouldn't be surprised by your bill.</p>

                <p>The tech industry has normalized chaos. We've accepted that understanding your hosting costs requires a spreadsheet and a prayer. We've decided that deployment should either be expensive or complicated, pick one. We've agreed that this is just how things are.</p>

                <p>But it's not. We can do better.</p>

                <p>Stackshift isn't trying to be the cheapest option or the fanciest option. We're trying to be the honest option. You'll know exactly what you're paying for. You'll see your costs in real time. You'll set a spending cap and actually stay under it. When something costs more, we'll tell you why before you commit.</p>

                <p>Is this revolutionary? No. It's basic respect for your time and money. The fact that this feels different says more about the industry than it does about us.</p>

                <p>We're building this in public, mistakes and all. We're starting with the African market because that's where the infrastructure gap is most obvious, but the problem exists everywhere. Developers in Lagos and developers in London both deserve better than what they're getting.</p>

                <p>Some people will say we're naive. That this business model can't work. That eventually we'll have to nickel and dime users like everyone else. Maybe they're right. But we're going to try anyway, because the alternative is accepting that this is as good as it gets.</p>

                <p>And I don't accept that.</p>
